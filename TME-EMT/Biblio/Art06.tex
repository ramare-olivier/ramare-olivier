\section{Size of $|\zeta(s)|$ and of $L$-series
}



Theorem 4 of \cite{Rademacher*59} gives
the convexity bound. See also section 4.1 of \cite{Trudgian*13}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1959)}

In the strip $-\eta\le \sigma\le 1+\eta$, $0 < \eta\le 1/2$, the Dedekind zeta
function $\zeta_K(s)$ belonging to the algebraic number field $K$ of degree
$n$ and discriminant $d$ satisfies the inequality
$$
|\zeta_K(s)|\le 3 \left|\frac{1+s}{1-s}\right|
\left(\frac{|d||1+s|}{2\pi}\right)^{\frac{1+\eta-\sigma}{2}}
\zeta(1+\eta)^n.
$$
\end{thm}


On the line $\Re s=1/2$, Lemma 2 of
\cite{Lehman*70} gives a better
result, namely

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1970)}

If $t\ge 1/5$, we have
$
|\zeta(\tfrac12+it)|\le 4 (t/(2\pi))^{1/4}
$.
\end{thm}

In fact, Lehman states this Theorem for $t\ge 64/(2\pi)$, but modern means of
computations makes it easy to check that it holds as soon as $t\ge 0.2$.
See also equation (56)
of \cite{Backlund*18} reproduced below.

For Dirichlet $L$-series, Theorem 3
of \cite{Rademacher*59} gives 
the corresponding convexity bound.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1959)}

In the strip $-\eta\le \sigma\le 1+\eta$, $0 < \eta\le 1/2$, for all moduli $q
> 1$ and all primitive
characters $\chi$ modulo $q$, the inequality 
$$
|L(s,\chi)|\le  
\left(q\frac{|1+s|}{2\pi}\right)^{\frac{1+\eta-\sigma}{2}}
\zeta(1+\eta)
$$
holds.
\end{thm}

This paper contains other similar convexity bounds.


Corollary to Theorem 3
of \cite{Cheng-Graham*01} goes beyond convexity. 


\begin{thm}{Theorem (2001)}

  For $0\le t\le e$, we have $|\zeta(\tfrac12+it)|\le 2.657$. For $t\ge e$, we
  have $|\zeta(\tfrac12+it)|\le 3t^{1/6}\log t$.
  Section 5 of \cite{Trudgian*13}
  shows that one can replace the constant 3 by 2.38.
\end{thm}


It is often useful to have a representation of the Riemann zeta function
or of $L$-series inside the critical strip. In the case of $L$-series,
\cite{Spira*69}
and
\cite{Rumely*93}
proceed via decomposition in Hurwitz zeta function which they compute through
an Euler-MacLaurin development. We have a more efficient approximation of the
Riemann zeta function provided by the Riemann Siegel formula, see
for instance equations (3-2)--(3.3)
of \cite{Odlyzko*87}. This
expression is due to 
\cite{Gabcke*79}.
See also 
equations (2.4)-(2.5) of
\cite{Lehman*66}, a corrected
version of Theorem 2 of \cite{Titchmarsh*47}.


In general, we have the following estimate taken from equations
(53)-(54), (56) and (76)
of  \cite{Backlund*18}
(see also \cite{Backlund*14}).

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1918)}

  
  When $t\ge 50$ and $\sigma\ge1$, we have $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|\le \log
  t-0.048$.
   When $t\ge 50$ and $0\le \sigma\le1$, we have $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|\le
  \frac{t^2}{t^2-4}\left(\frac{t}{2\pi}\right)^{\frac{1-\sigma}{2}}\log t$.
  
   When $t\ge 50$ and $-1/2\le \sigma\le0$, we have $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|\le
  \left(\frac{t}{2\pi}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}-\sigma}\log t$.
  
  
\end{thm}



On the line $\Re s=1$, one can rely on
\cite{Trudgian*12b}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (2012)}

  When $t\ge 3$, we have $|\zeta(1+it)|\le\tfrac34 \log t$.
\end{thm}


Asymptotically better bounds are available since the huge work of
\cite{Ford*02}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (2002)}

  When $t\ge 3$ and $1/2\le \sigma\le 1$, we have $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|\le 76.2
  t^{4.45(1-\sigma)^{3/2} } (\log t)^{2/3}$.
\end{thm}

The constants are still too large for this result to be of use in any decent
region. See \cite{Kulas*94} for an
earlier estimate.






\section{On the total number of zeroes
}


The first explicit estimate for the number of zeros of the Riemann
$\zeta$-function goes back to
\cite{Backlund*14}.
An elegant consequence of the result of Backlund is the following easy
estimate taken from Lemma 1 of
\cite{Lehman*66a}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1966)}

If $\varphi$ is a continuous function which is positive and monotone
decreasing for $2\pi e\le T_1\le t\le T_2$, then
$$
\sum_{T_1 < \gamma\le T_2} \varphi(\gamma)
            =\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\varphi(t)\log\frac{t}{2\pi}dt
            +O^*\biggl(4\varphi(T_1)\log
            T_1+2\int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{\varphi(t)}{t}
            dt\biggr)
            $$
             where the summation is over all zeros of the Riemann
            $\zeta$-function of
            imaginary part between $T_1$ and $T_2$, with multiplicity.
\end{thm}


Theorem 19 of
\cite{Rosser*41}
gives a bound for the total number of zeroes.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1941)}

For $T\ge2$, we have
$$
N(T)=\sum_{\substack{\rho,\\ 0 < \gamma\le T}} 1=
            \frac{T}{2\pi}\log\frac{T}{2\pi}-\frac{T}{2\pi}+\frac{7}{8}
            +O^*\Bigl(0.137\log T+0.443\log\log T+1.588
            \Bigr)
            $$
            where the summation is over all zeros of the Riemann
            $\zeta$-function of
            imaginary part between 0 and $T$, with multiplicity.
\end{thm}


It is noted in Lemma 1 of
\cite{Ramare-Saouter*02}
that the $O$-term can be replaced by the simpler
$O^*(0.67\log\frac{T}{2\pi})$ when $T\ge 10^3$.

This is improved in Corollary 1 of
\cite{Trudgian*13}
into
\begin{thm}{Theorem (1941)}

For $T\ge e$, we have
$$
N(T)=\sum_{\substack{\rho,\\ 0 < \gamma\le T}} 1=
            \frac{T}{2\pi}\log\frac{T}{2\pi}-\frac{T}{2\pi}+\frac{7}{8}
            +O^*\bigl(0.112\log T+0.278\log\log T+2.510+\frac{1}{5T}
            \bigr)
            $$
            where the summation is over all zeros of the Riemann
            $\zeta$-function of
            imaginary part between 0 and $T$, with multiplicity.
\end{thm}







\section{L${}^2$-averages
}



\section{Bounds on the real line
}


After some estimates
from \cite{Bastion-Rogalaski*02}, 
Lemma 5.1 of \cite{Ramare*13d} shows
the following.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (2013)}

  When $\sigma> 1$ and $t$ is any real number, we have $|\zeta(\sigma+it)|\le   e^{\gamma(\sigma-1) }/(\sigma-1)$.
\end{thm}


Here is the Theorem of
\cite{Delange*87}.
See also Lemma 2.3 of
\cite{Ford*01} for a
slightly weaker version.

\begin{thm}{Theorem (1987)}

  When $\sigma> 1$ and $t$ is any real number, we have
  $$
  -\Re\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(\sigma+it)\le
  \frac{1}{\sigma-1}-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}.
  $$ 
\end{thm}
